                    Meditation is defined differently depending on experience and culture. Here are a few quotes about meditation:

                    I would like to define meditation from my own experience. Meditation is the art of grounding ones-self by clearing the mind and focusing on one's breath, allowing the individual to be present in mindfulness.
                    
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>

                    We can use meditation to help dissolve stress and balance ourselves. Even if you are new to meditating, it is never too late to start! Young or old, skilled or unexperienced, everyone can benefit from meditating on a regular basis.
